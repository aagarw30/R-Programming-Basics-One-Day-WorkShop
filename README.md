# R-Programming-Basics-One-Day-WorkShop
This repo contains references codes and material to the R Programming Work Shop that I conducted for an engineering college undergraduates in Bangalore, India

<b>Motivation :</b>
<br>
- Importance of Data mining, Data Analytics, Big Data, Data Mining.  
- Why make sense of data? - derive meaning information from data, drive business decisions, optimization, improve customer experience.  
- Some examples or success stories. 

<b>Learning Objectives of workshop:</b> <br>
Exposure to R Statistical Programming Language. Understand the basics of R - data structure of R, in built functions, packages, tools/techniques and use R for data analysis, visualization – illustration through few examples. By the end of the workshop you should be able to start using R and analyze data.

<b>WorkShop Topics :</b><br>
R command line interface – A quick introduction, various sections, file types, extension,

RStudio – A quick introduction,

Working directory,

R as a basic calculator – examples using few mathematical expressions,

Assignment operator – an example of how to assign values to a variable (rather Object) in R

Basic functions in R – few examples of in-built functions (user defined functions and functions that comes with packages will be introduced later)

Tip # 1 – how to get the previously executed commands (arrow keys)

Tip #2 – How to get help in R

Data Structure in R – vector, data frame, lists, matrix etc with examples

Check the attributes and class for a given object

Access variables from data frame using $ sign 

Vector – example, coercion

Extraction of elements,

Str() – structure of data frame,

Summary() – numerical summary of each of the variables,

Looping and functions,

Correlation, Regression, Basic plots (using R inbuilt datasets – iris dataset and mtcars or other datasets) 

Summary Statistics

Scatterplot,

Bar chart,

Histogram 

Correlation

Linear regression model

Exploratory data analysis (using an external dataset) 

Loading data from external file and reading the data,

Sub setting data from data frame,

Other frequently used functions

How to install an external package

Data Visualization - Ggplot2 package – an example using external dataset
